**What is this app about?**

This web application is specifically designed to help college students navigate the challenging process of finding a suitable roommate. College can be an overwhelming and stressful experience, and finding the right person to share a living space with can be a significant source of anxiety. This web app aims to make the roommate-finding process as simple and stress-free as possible.

The app will be divided into 7 main pages: Home page, Browse page, About us page, Support page, FAQ page, Chat page, Account page

1. **HOME PAGE**
- The Home page is the landing page of the web app, and it features a login/sign-up card that allows users to log in or create an account. This page is designed to ensure the security of the user's information and to limit access to non-college students.

2. **BROWSE PAGE**
- The Browse page includes a search engine that allows users to find potential roommates by filtering through different profiles. Each profile displayed will have a save button for the user to save potential roommates on their saved list. Additionally, there is a chat button that enables users to interact with their potential roommates and share interests.

3. **ABOUT US PAGE**
- The About Us page provides information about the web app, including its purpose, establishment, and goals. This page aims to give users a clear understanding of the web app and its intended purpose.

4. **SUPPORT PAGE**
- The Support page includes a drop-down menu that allows users to contact the admin of the roommates finder app for any assistance they may need.

5. **FAQ PAGE**
- The FAQ page displays frequently asked questions from users on how to use the web app. This page aims to provide users with clear instructions on how to navigate through the web app and its features.

6. **CHAT PAGE**
- The Chat page is a platform that allows users to communicate directly with other users. This page enables users to build relationships with potential roommates before deciding to live together.

7. **ACCOUNT PAGE**
- The Account page includes a user profile that allows users to change their information and access their saved list. This page enables users to manage their preferences and make changes to their saved list.

**Software and Technology:**

- FrontEnd: Angular, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Typescript, Javascript
